1. (question 1) A class is a programming construct that defines the common state and behavior of a group of similar objects

2. (question 2) Through its access control mechanism (public, private and protected members).

3. (question 3) A class has a name, and it describes the state (member data) and services (member functions) 
    provided by objects that are instances of that class. The runtime system creates each object based on a class definition.

4. (question 4)Member data describes the state of the object from this class , 
    while member functions describes the action that can be done to the object and its state and how it change .

6. (question 6)Constractor is called once the object is called (constractor set the object to its default settings),
    Destructor is called automatically when the program exits the block of code in which the object is defined.

8. (question 8)A default constructor is a constructor that is used to create an object 
    when you donâ€™t provide explicit initialization values and is called with no arguments.

10. (question 10)(this) pointer points to the object itself.
